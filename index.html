                    <h1>Naruto classic</h1>
                    <p>Naruto Uzumaki is a young ninja who bears a great power hidden inside him, a power that has isolated him from the rest of his village. As such, his only dream is to become the Hokage - the most powerful ninja, and leader of the village; but first he needs to graduate! With his inability to perform even the most basic ninja techniques, it seems that all Naruto has going for him is his determination to succeed no matter what. Teamed up with the genius Sasuke, book-smart Sakura, and their team leader Kakashi, Naruto embarks on his quest to become the Hokage. But with outside forces posing a threat to the entire Hidden Leaf village, Naruto discovers that he must become much stronger if he ever wants to realize his dream and protect the friendships he's forged.</p>
                    <p>Once, the ninja village of Konohagakure was attacked by an evil nine-tailed fox spirit. This demon slaughtered many people until the leader of Konohagakure, the 4th Hokage, sacrificed his life to seal the fox inside a newborn child - Naruto Uzumaki. Now, twelve years later, Naruto is a member of the Ninja Academy; but due to his past Naruto is shunned by the rest of the village, and since he has no friends or family he plays the part of class idiot to get attention. However, he is determined to gain respect by becoming the next Hokage - the most powerful shinobi in the village. With his apparent lack of abilities, will Naruto be able to realize his goal through determination alone?</p>

                <h3>Fight Begins</h3>
                <p>Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha are the two most iconic characters from Naruto. These two are destined to do battle from birth despite being teammates during their early training days and they wind up fighting many times.</p>
                <p>It’s no secret to those who have watched the series that the relationship between Naruto and Sasuke is the core of the show’s plot, and throughout the run of both the original Naruto series and Naruto Shippuden, both get stronger and face off with newfound abilities.</p>
                <p>Both series reach their climaxes with combat between these two characters, and while these might be the most popular of their fights, the characters face off quite a few times during each show’s run. Here’s a list of all the instances where you can see the two shinobi do battle.</p>
